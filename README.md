# Japanese-American Baby Name Identifier

My wife and I are expecting our second child soon and are having a difficult time selecting a name.
The constraint that we've given ourselves is that the name must seem natural in both English and Japanese.
For example, 'Erika' is easily pronounceable for and sounds appealing to native speakers of both languages.

I had an idea to write a program that would help us find names that had this characteristic. This is it.

Caveat: The algorithm is pretty naive, but it generates a pretty good list that served its purpose as inspiration.

The [US Census data on baby names](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/background.html) for the last 135 years
is here in this project in src/main/resources. Its only 23MB.

This is really here for my own amusement and posterity, though if you find this useful, do let me know.
